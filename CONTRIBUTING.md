## Development

### Git Workflow

1. Create a `feature` branch off `main`
2. Work locally adhering to coding standards
3. When ready, open a draft Pull Request on Github
4. When finished, fill out the PR template and publish your PR
5. Your PR must pass assertions and deploy successfully
6. After peer review, the PR will be merged back into `main`
7. Repeat ‚ôªÔ∏è

### PR Preview Deployments

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/webdevstudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter) is connected to this Github repository and will automatically build and deploy a unique URL for each Pull Request.

### Code Linting

This project has several rulesets and uses ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint to enforce standards.

In addition to real-time linting, you could run the following commands in your terminal. These commands are also used by Lefthook during a commit.

Lint JavaScript:

```bash
npm run lint:js
```

Lint CSS:

```bash
npm run lint:css
```

Format your code:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Tips to help your PR get approved

1. Make sure your code editor supports real-time linting and has the [recommended extensions](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/wiki/recommended-extensions) installed
2. [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) are required for all JavaScript functions
3. Run `npm run build && npm run start` before submitting your PR, to ensure a successful build
4. Be courteous in your communications
